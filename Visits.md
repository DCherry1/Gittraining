## Disfellowshipped or Disassociated Ones: 
>For this year, prior to the special talk, the
Congregation Service Committee should meet to assign elders to make brief contact with disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who qualify for a visit. **_(sfl chap. 25 par. 20)_** Contact should not be made with an active apostate, with one who is trying to lead others into sin,or with one who has made it clear that he does not want to be contacted by the congregation. 
#### **_Notes to Share_**
1. Luke 15:11-20 “While [the son] was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him."
2. Isaiah 1:18 “‘Come, now, and let us set matters straight between us,’ says Jehovah. ‘Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be made as white as snow.’”
>Yes, even sins that seem as indelible as scarlet dye on a white garment are not beyond Jehovah’s forgiveness
* Jehovah does not want you to keep suffering with a **_guilty conscience_**
* Remember, Jehovah has already invited you to approach him in prayer and to “set matters straight” with him. Accept that invitation
>Confess your sins to Jehovah, and share your feelings with him. From personal experience, David could confidently pray: “Cleanse me from my sin. . . . A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.”​—Psalm 51:2, 17.

> “Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.”​—HEBREWS 5:14.
[The Watchtower 1999 September 1, pp. 13-18](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1999643)

### Special Note: 
1. “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate,” says Jeremiah 17:9. 
2. Without godly principles to guide us, we can deceive ourselves into thinking that something bad is good​—simply because our flesh craves it. **(Compare Isaiah 5:20.)**
  Woe to those who say that good is bad and bad is good,Those who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, Those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
